          <hr />
          <p>
            Career counseling is a process that assists you in understanding
            yourself and the world around you in order to make career decisions
            as well as educational, personal, and professional decisions.
            Developing a career entails more than just deciding on a major and
            what job you want to get after graduation. To find the best career
            match, we combine personality and interests with abilities. It is
            not required that what you are capable of doing will make you happy.
            The goal of career counseling is to help you make the right decision
            by providing you with enough information to make educated decisions.
